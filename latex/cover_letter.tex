\opening{Dear Editor-in-Chief,}

I am pleased to submit my manuscript entitled ``\textbf{Sovereign Federated Learning with Byzantine-Resilient Aggregation: A Framework for Decentralized AI Infrastructure in Emerging Economies}'' for consideration for publication in the Journal of Machine Learning Research.

\section*{Summary of Contributions}

This paper presents DSAIN (Distributed Sovereign AI Network), a novel federated learning framework addressing critical challenges in deploying AI infrastructure for emerging economies. The key contributions include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{FedSov Algorithm}: A communication-efficient federated learning algorithm achieving $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence for non-convex objectives while reducing communication costs by 78\% compared to standard federated averaging, with formal convergence guarantees under heterogeneous data distributions.
    
    \item \textbf{ByzFed Aggregation}: A Byzantine-resilient aggregation mechanism with provable robustness guarantees, tolerating up to $\lfloor(n-1)/3\rfloor$ malicious participants while maintaining performance within 5\% of clean accuracy under 20\% Byzantine attacks.
    
    \item \textbf{Privacy-Utility Integration}: Formal $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy guarantees with tight composition analysis for multi-round federated learning, achieving 88.1\% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with $\epsilon=4$ privacy budget.
    
    \item \textbf{Blockchain-Based Provenance}: A lightweight model provenance system using cryptographic commitments and Proof-of-Training consensus, enabling verifiable and auditable federated learning without on-chain model storage overhead.
    
    \item \textbf{Real-World Deployment}: Comprehensive evaluation including a large-scale deployment case study demonstrating practical viability for distributed computing environments.
\end{enumerate}

The work advances federated learning by simultaneously addressing three critical challenges---communication efficiency, Byzantine resilience, and privacy preservation---within a unified framework with provable guarantees.

The framework is particularly timely given increasing global focus on AI sovereignty, data localization requirements, and the need for privacy-preserving collaborative learning systems. I anticipate this work will enable emerging economies to participate more effectively in AI development while maintaining data sovereignty.
